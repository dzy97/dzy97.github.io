About Me
------
Hi! I am Zheye Deng (邓哲也). I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) advised by [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), where I was advised by [Prof. Ming Zhang](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1238/2063.htm).

My research interest mainly focus on the integration of graph structures and natural language in machine learning, including the construction of large-scale knowledge graphs, as well as extracting and integrating structural information from texts to enhance the ability to answer complex queries. Currently, I am investigating LLM-based agent reinforcement learning and challenges in asynchronous RL.
